# Shulgi
Chrome Extension for reading languages.

Like the Sumerian king Shulgi, this extension can handle many languages
easily. The standout feature of this extension is its ability to remove new
lines from a text that is copied from a pdf, and open that text in Google
Translate. However, it also supports looking up words in the best online
multilingual dictionaries. 

## Using the Extension 

To retrive text that has been copied into the system clipboard, click on the
extensions icon. Then on the extensions popup menu click the button that says
"Get Translation!". A new tab will be generated with the text in Google Translation. 

To look up a word you can type it into the text box and hit the return key, or
the button marked "Define!". If no language code is specified, a new tab will
be generated defining it in Google Translate. You can specify a language using
ISO langauge codes, and then tabs will be generated in the dictionaries that
have been chosen by the developer. This chrome extension currently supports:
German (de), Korean (ko), French (fr), Hebrew (he), Chinese (zh), and
Spanish(sp).

but this gist was invaluable for getting the Chrome to play nicely with the clipboard:
