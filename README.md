Chrome Extension for Google Translate

I am trying to play with this tutorial https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted to make a simple chrome extension.
Also, referencing this tutorial: https://www.sitepoint.com/create-chrome-extension-10-minutes-flat/

This chrome extension currently supports: German (de), Korean (ko), French (fr), and Spanish(sp). Other language codes will be processed with google translate
