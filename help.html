To retrive text that has been copied into the system clipboard, click on the
extensions icon. Then on the extensions popup menu click the button that says
"Get Translation!". A new tab will be generated with the text in Google Translate. 

To look up a word you can type it into the text box and hit the return key, or
the button marked "Define!". If no language code is specified, a new tab will
be generated defining it in Google Translate. You can specify a language using
[ISO langauge codes][iso], and then tabs will be generated in the dictionaries that
have been chosen by the developer. This chrome extension currently supports:
German (de), Korean (ko), French (fr), Hebrew (he), Chinese (zh), and
Spanish (sp). To use the language codes, seperate the language code from the
search term with a colon(:).Like: `de: Hallo`, or `sp: hola`. The list of
supported urls gets updated pretty frequently, please see
[config.js](config.js), for an updated list of the currently supported terms.

Shulgi also supports keyboard shortcuts. On Windows `Ctrl+Shift+U` will open
the popup html file. And `Ctrl+Shift+Y` will open Google Translate with
whatever is in the clipboard. For Mac, just use the `Cmd` key. Both of these
keyboard shortcuts can by combined: Hold down `Ctrl+Shift`, and then press `U` 
and then `Y` and Shulgi will open the Google Translate page.
