# About Shulgi 
This app is named after the URIII king, Shulgi. He reigned over the region of
Southern Mesopotamia during the late third millenium. But why name an app that
aids in languages after him? One thing that is unique in the inscriptions of
Shulgi is his confidence and proclamations of how great a scholar is.
Assurbanipal also talks about his ability to read Cuneiform, but not to the
same extent that Shugli does. The wikipedia article on [Shulgi][ShulgiW] is a
great place to start. Many of the literature written about Shulgi is available
throug the Electronic Text Corpus of the Sumerian Literature ([ETCSL][etcsl]). 

## Education 

The text that inspires the name for this app is the [Shulgi Hymn B][ShulgiB].
Like many ancient Near Eastern kings, much of the material written by Shulgi
and his court is praise for his idealness as a ruler. In order to show how
ideal of a ruler he is, he starts with a biography includeing his early life
as a student in the scribal schools.
>    (11-20) I am a king, offspring begotten by a king and borne by a queen.
>    I, Šulgi the noble, have been blessed with a favourable destiny right
>    from the womb. When I was small, I was at the academy, where I learned
>    the scribal art from the tablets of Sumer and Akkad. None of the nobles
>    could write on clay as I could. There where people regularly went for
>    tutelage in the scribal art, I qualified fully in subtraction, addition,
>    reckoning and accounting. The fair Nanibgal, Nisaba, provided me amply
>    with knowledge and comprehension. I am an experienced scribe who does not
>    neglect a thing (ETCSL)

It is interesting to note that the nobles were taught also in these scribal
schools. Reading and writing are not the only skills taught in the scribal
schools, he also has learned all of the important disciplines of his day:
arithmatic, accounting, and even astrology. The languages that were taught in
the scribal schools were Akkadian and Sumerian. 

## Languages of Shulgi

But not only could he write the languages of Sumerian and Akkadian (the
languages of ancient Southern Mesopotamia), Shulgi also new all of the
languages of his world: 
>    (206-220) When I …… like a torrent with the roar of a great storm, in the
>    capture of a citadel in Elam ……, I can understand what their spokesman
>    answers. By origin I am a son of Sumer; I am a warrior, a warrior of
>    Sumer. Thirdly, I can conduct a conversation with a man from the black
>    mountains. Fourthly, I can do service as a translator with a man of
>    Martu, a man of the mountains ……. I myself can correct his confused words
>    in his own language.  Fifthly, when a man of Subir yells ……, I can even
>    distinguish the words in his language, although I am not a fellow-citizen
>    of his. When I provide justice in the legal cases of Sumer, I give
>    answers in all five languages. In my palace no one in conversation
>    switches to another language as quickly as I do. (ETCSL)

Shulgi is a fascinating king of the ancient Near East, and one worthy of study!
